        <h2>Scenario - Takeoff & Landing</h2>
        <p>Various scenarios are used in an airport to discuss the concepts related to programming. Let us take a look at few of the processes that happen during takeoff and landing.</p>
        <p>In the airport, there are many flights landing and taking off. Unlike road traffic, the flights don’t have direct information of other flights around them. The Air Traffic Control (ATC) at the ground gives instructions to each flight on what it should do.</p>
        <p>Similarly, instructions are provided to computers to accomplish specific tasks. Such instructions are known as programs, and the act of creating a program is known as programming.</p>

    <h2>Algorithm & its Representation</h2>
    <p>Algorithm should be represented from the mental thoughts into a form which others can understand. There are primarily two ways of representing an algorithm:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Flow chart: Diagrammatic way of representing the algorithm.</li>
      <li>Pseudo-code: Representing the algorithm between a program and normal English.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example, here is a pseudo-code and a flowchart:</p>
      <img src="4.png" alt="Image Description">
     <p>Process is basically a sequence of computations to be performed using some Logic. This is also known as an Algorithm. Different logic gives rise to different algorithms.</p>
      <img src="3.png" alt="Image Description">
     <p>Pseudo-code cannot be executed by a computer. It is representation of an algorithm for programmer to understand.</p>

    <h2>Operators</h2>
    <p>Like assignment operator, there are other operators which can be used to perform various operations.</p>
    <h3>Arithmetic Operators:</h3>
    <p>Arithmetic operators are used for performing arithmetic operations:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Operator</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>Addition</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>Subtraction</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>*</td>
        <td>Multiplication</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/</td>
        <td>Division</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>%</td>
        <td>Modulus</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Relational Operators:</h3>
    <p>Relational operators, also known as comparison operators, are used to compare values. The result of a relational expression is always either true or false:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Operator</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>==</td>
        <td>Equal to</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&lt;</td>
        <td>Less than</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&gt;</td>
        <td>Greater than</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&lt;=</td>
        <td>Less than or equal to</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&gt;=</td>
        <td>Greater than or equal to</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>!=</td>
        <td>Not equal to</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Logical Operators</h2>
    <p>Logical operators are used to combine one or more relational expressions:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Operator</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>AND</td>
        <td>Result will be true if both the expressions are true. If any one or both the expressions are false, the result will be false.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>OR</td>
        <td>Result will be true even if one of the expressions is true. If both the expressions are false, the result will be false.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>NOT</td>
        <td>If the expression is true, the result will be false and vice versa.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>If A and B are two relational expressions, say A = (Num1 &gt; 2000), B = (Num2 &gt; 100), the result of combining A and B using logical operators is based on the result of A and B as shown below:</p>

    <h2>Decision Constructs</h2>
    <p>In a pseudo-code, typically the instructions are performed one by one or line by line. But there may be situations when all the statements in a pseudo-code are not performed. Parts of the pseudo-code which change the flow of instructions or change the flow of control are called as control structures.</p>

    <h2>Decision Making in Air Traffic Control</h2>
    <p>ATC takes a lot of decisions as part of its air traffic control operations.</p>
    <p>For example, if a flight is approaching the runway, ATC should check if the runway is free. If the runway is not free, then the flight should not land immediately. It should circle in the air and wait for further instructions from the ATC.</p>
    <p>Such decision-making process can be conveniently represented in a pseudo-code using an if statement.</p>
      <img src="11.png" alt="Image Description">

     <p>Sometimes, ATC may have more than one alternative for a given situation. For example, if the runway is free, the flight can land. But if the flight has less fuel, then it should be allowed an emergency landing. Otherwise, it should circle in the air.</p>

    <h2>Quiz - Iteration Constructs</h2>
 <img src="13.png" alt="Image Description">
      <h2>Pseudo-code Analysis</h2>
    <p>The program takes an input value for the variable Counter.</p>
    <p>It enters a while loop with the condition Counter &lt; 5.</p>
    <p>Inside the loop, it increments Counter by 1 and then displays its value.</p>
    <p>The loop continues as long as the condition Counter &lt; 5 is true.</p>
    <p>Given that the initial input value provided to Counter is 1, let's see how the loop executes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Counter is initially set to 1.</li>
      <li>In the first iteration of the loop, Counter is incremented by 1, becoming 2, and then displayed.</li>
      <li>Since Counter is now 2, the condition Counter &lt; 5 is still true.</li>
      <li>In the second iteration, Counter is again incremented by 1, becoming 3, and displayed.</li>
      <li>Counter is still less than 5, so the loop continues.</li>
      <li>In the third iteration, Counter becomes 4 and is displayed.</li>
      <li>After this iteration, Counter is still less than 5, so the loop continues.</li>
      <li>In the fourth iteration, Counter becomes 5 and is displayed.</li>
      <li>Now, Counter is no longer less than 5, so the loop terminates.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So, the output of the pseudo-code when the input value for Counter is 1 will be:</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>5</p>
      <h2>Pseudo-code Loop</h2>
    <p>In the code, the loop starts by checking if Counter is less than 5. But since the initial value of Counter is 1, which is not less than 5, the loop doesn't even start for this initial value. The loop only starts when Counter becomes 2 because then it's less than 5. That's why the number 1 wasn't displayed.</p>
    <p>If you want the number 1 to be displayed as well, you'd need to change the loop condition to check if Counter is less than or equal to 5. That way, the loop will include the initial value of Counter, which is 1.</p>

   <div class="container">
    <h2>What is a Programming Language?</h2>
    <p>Pseudo-code helped us to represent the algorithms and learn a few basics of programming. But to instruct the computer, we need to write a program in a programming language. There are many languages available in which we can write our programs.</p>
    <p>Different languages are created for different purposes. This involves trade-offs. For example, a large flight can carry many passengers, but also consumes a lot of fuel. Similarly, different languages have different advantages.</p>
  <img src="14.png" alt="Image Description">
        <h2>Code Breakdown and Output Prediction</h2>
    <p>We have two variables: airline which stores the name of the airline, and luggage_weight which stores the weight of the luggage.</p>
    <p>We have two airlines: "AirIndia" and "Emirates", each with their respective weight limits (AI_weight_limit and EM_weight_limit).</p>
    <p>The code checks the airline using an if-elif-else structure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the airline is "AirIndia", it checks if the luggage weight is less than or equal to the weight limit for AirIndia (AI_weight_limit). If it is, it prints "Check-in cleared", otherwise, it prints "Remove some luggage and come back".</li>
      <li>If the airline is "Emirates", it does the same check with the weight limit for Emirates (EM_weight_limit).</li>
      <li>If the airline is neither "AirIndia" nor "Emirates", it prints "Invalid airline".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, let's predict the output:</p>
    <p>Since the airline variable is set to "AirIndia", and the luggage_weight is 28, which is less than the weight limit for AirIndia (30), the condition luggage_weight &lt;= AI_weight_limit is true. Therefore, the output will be:</p>
    <p><strong>Check-in cleared</strong></p>
    <p>This is because the code will enter the first if block and execute the statement <code>print("Check-in cleared")</code>.</p>
       <img src="15.png" alt="Image Description">
       <h2>Code Explanation and Output Prediction</h2>
    <p>We have two variables: no_of_passengers storing the number of passengers and ticket_number storing the starting ticket number.</p>
    <p>The code prints "Ticket Numbers for all the Passengers:" as the initial message.</p>
    <p>It enters a while loop that continues as long as no_of_passengers is greater than 0.</p>
    <p>Inside the loop, it prints the current ticket number along with a prefix "T -".</p>
    <p>It increments the ticket_number by 1 for the next passenger.</p>
    <p>It decrements no_of_passengers by 1 to keep track of the number of passengers processed.</p>
    <p>Now, let's predict the output:</p>
    <p>Since no_of_passengers is initially set to 3, the loop will execute 3 times. It will print the ticket numbers for each passenger, starting from 1001 and incrementing by 1 for each passenger.</p>
    <p>So, the output will be:</p>
    <pre><code>
      Ticket Numbers for all the Passengers:
      T - 1001
      T - 1002
      T - 1003
    </code></pre>
    <p>Each line represents a passenger's ticket number.</p>

    <h2>Data Types in Programming</h2>
    <p>We know that a program works on data or values. Some examples of values are 1, 1.0, and "Hello".</p>
    <p>For a program to use a data, it must be stored in a memory location. The values are stored in binary form in computer memory.</p>
    <p>How do we know how many bits are required to represent a value or how much space it needs in memory?</p>
    <p>This is determined by the data type of the value and the programming language. For example, number, string, etc. Thus, every value will have a type.</p>

    <h2>Try Out - Data Types</h2>
    <p>Problem Statement:</p>
    <p>In Python, the data type of a value can be identified by using <code>type(value)</code>.</p>
    <p>Try out the below program and observe the results:</p>

    <h2>Understanding Variables in Programming</h2>
    <p>If everything is a value, then what is a variable?</p>
    <p>A variable is a name that is assigned to a value. It is done so that we can refer to that value at some later point in the program.</p>
    <p>Let us see the usage of values and variables in a program:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>During input, we receive values and assign them to variables.</li>
      <li>During processing, we perform operations on values and variables to generate more values. These computed values are also assigned to variables.</li>
      <li>During output, we display the computed values in variables to the end users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let’s have a look at the Python program to display the number of landings and number of takeoffs in an airport:</p>
    <p>Note: In Python, <code>print()</code> can be used to display output in the console.</p>
  </div>
    </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Try out the below program. This is the program for a pseudo-code which we had discussed earlier.</p>
    <p>Change the value of no_of_landings, no_of_takeoffs, and initial_no_of_flights, execute and observe the output:</p>
    <pre><code>
      no_of_landings = 356
      no_of_takeoffs = 245
      initial_no_of_flights = 100
      current_no_of_flights = initial_no_of_flights + no_of_landings - no_of_takeoffs
      print("Current number of flights:", current_no_of_flights)
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Execution Result</h2>
    <p>Output:</p>
    <p><strong>Current number of flights: 211</strong></p>
  </div>
   <div class="container">
    <h2>Variables & Datatypes</h2>
    <p>Languages like Python are dynamically typed whereas C, Go, etc., are statically typed.</p>
    <p>Dynamic Typing is a technique in some languages where depending on how a value is used, the data type of the variable is dynamically and automatically assigned. Consider the below code in Python:</p>
    <pre><code>
      num = 65 # Line 1
      num = "A" # Line 2
    </code></pre>
    <p>In Line 1, variable num is considered to be of type int and in Line 2, its type is reassigned to String.</p>
    <p>Static Typing is used in some languages where the data type has to be declared before a variable is used. Consider the below code in Go:</p>
    <pre><code>
      var num int = 65; // Line 1
      num = "A"; // Line 2 (Invalid)
      var name string = "A"; // Line 3
    </code></pre>
    <p>Here, Line 1 is a valid statement which declares a variable num of type int. But Line 2 is invalid as we cannot assign a string value to variable num which is already declared to be of type int. Line 3 is a valid statement where name is declared and used as a string.</p>
  <p>Any name can be given to a variable however, we cannot use some of the built-in keywords of the language. These keywords are known as reserved words.
      Some of the reserved words in Python are:</p>
      <p>Python: if, else, for, while, def, print, raise, try, except</p>
   </div>
 <div class="container">
    <h2>Storing Data</h2>
    <p>If you put a small product in a big box, you may end up wasting space. Similarly, if you put a big product in a small box, you may end up damaging the product.</p>
    <p>Just like a product is placed in a box, data occupies memory. Some data need more memory whereas some other data require less memory based on the data type.</p>
    <p>In Python language, automatically creates just the right memory needed – neither less nor more.</p>
       <img src="20.png" alt="Image Description">
       <img src="21.JPG" alt="Image Description">
     <p>We have seen that a variable will have a name, value, type and it will occupy memory. Apart from these, it has two more dimensions – scope and lifetime. Thus we can say that any variable will have the following six dimensions.</p>

    <h2>Operators in Python</h2>
    <p>As we discussed in pseudo-code, operators help to perform an operation.</p>
    <p>Some of the most common operators used in Python are listed below:</p>
    <h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>+</li>
      <li>-</li>
      <li>*</li>
      <li>/</li>
      <li>%</li>
      <li>//</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Relational Operators</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>==</li>
      <li>!=</li>
      <li>&gt;</li>
      <li>&lt;</li>
      <li>&gt;=</li>
      <li>&lt;=</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Assignment Operators</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>=</li>
      <li>+=</li>
      <li>-=</li>
      <li>*=</li>
      <li>/=</li>
      <li>%=</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Logical Operators</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>and</li>
      <li>or</li>
      <li>not</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: In Python, // indicates integer division.</p>
    <p>Example: 11 // 2 = 5</p>
      <div class="container">
    <h2>True and False Values in Python</h2>
    <p>The result of a relational or logical expression is always a boolean (true or false). Apart from the boolean values, other values can also be used to represent a true or false value.</p>
    <p>For example, in Python, value zero is considered to be equivalent to false.</p>
    <p>The common false values in Python are given below. Any other value is considered to be true.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>None</li>
      <li>False</li>
      <li>0</li>
      <li>'' / "" (Empty string - two single quotes/double quotes)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  </div>
 <div class="container">
    <h2>Expression Evaluation in Python</h2>
    <p>What do you think is the output of <code>5 + 4 * 9 % (3 + 1) / 6 - 1</code>?</p>
    <p>How do you think the result of this expression is computed?</p>
    <p>It is done based on the precedence of the operators. Precedence of an operator can be identified based on the rule - BODMAS. Brackets followed by Orders (Powers, Roots), followed by modulo, Division and Multiplication, followed by Addition and Subtraction.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Brackets have the highest precedence followed by orders.</li>
      <li>Modulo, Division, and Multiplication have the same precedence. Hence if all appear in an expression, they are evaluated from Left to Right.</li>
      <li>Addition and Subtraction have the same precedence. Hence if both appear in an expression, they are evaluated from Left to Right.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implicit & Explicit Type Conversion</h2>
    <p>Take a look at the below code:</p>
    <pre><code>num = 1 + 1.0</code></pre>
    <p>The result is 2.0!</p>
    <p>Why do you think the result is 2.0?</p>
    <p>Here we were actually expecting the output as 2 but Python automatically converted 1 into a float and added with 1.0. This is known as implicit conversion.</p>
    <p>Implicit conversions are dangerous as one may encounter unexpected results.</p>
    <p>Take a look at the below code:</p>
    <pre><code>num = 1 + int(1.0)</code></pre>
    <p>The result will be 2!</p>
    <p>If we want the output as 2, then we have to explicitly convert the float 1.0 into integer 1. This is known as explicit conversion. Explicit conversion involves mentioning the data type within brackets explicitly.</p>
    <p>Programming languages define their own rule for implicit and explicit conversions and these rules will change from language to language.</p>
      <h2>Conversion in Python</h2>
    <p>We noticed that implicit conversions are dangerous as one may encounter unexpected results.</p>
    <p>Similarly, one has to be careful in explicit conversions as well. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Converting a floating-point value to an integer would result in the loss of decimal point values.</li>
      <li>A larger data type if converted to a smaller data type will result in the loss of data as the number will be truncated.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conversion to int</h3>
    <p><code>int()</code></p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre><code>num = int("10")</code></pre>
    <p>Value of num will be 10</p>
    <h3>Conversion to string</h3>
    <p><code>str()</code></p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre><code>num = str(10)</code></pre>
    <p>Value of num will be "10"</p>

    <p>Though we can give any name to a variable other than reserved words, Google has come up with style guides for most of the programming languages. These style guides help to bring in uniformity and enhance readability of programs written by programmers across the world.</p>
    <p>As per Google style guide, variable names in Python should be written as <code>var_name</code>.</p>
    <p>The pattern followed in Python is known as <strong>snake_case</strong>.</p>
    <p>Apart from this, it is important to place comments wherever possible to explain code and use meaningful variable names. Comment is an explanation provided in the code which makes it easier to understand for a person who is going through the code.</p>
    <p>These are all part of coding standards which is a set of guidelines that can be used to enhance the readability and clarity of the program. It also makes it easier to debug and maintain the program.</p>

    <h2>Explanation:</h2>

    <p>Input Number: We start by getting the number as input from the user.</p>
    <p>Initialize Variables: We set up two variables: Temp to store the original number and Reverse to store the reversed number. We also initialize Reverse to 0.</p>
    <p>Reverse the Number: Using a loop, we extract each digit from the number (Remainder = Number % 10), add it to the Reverse variable after multiplying it by 10 to shift the digits to the left (Reverse = Reverse * 10 + Remainder), and then remove the last digit from the original number (Number = Number / 10).</p>
    <p>Check Palindrome: After the loop, we compare the original number (Temp) with the reversed number (Reverse). If they are equal, we display "Palindrome"; otherwise, we display "Not a Palindrome".</p>
  <h2>Explanation:</h2>

    <p>Input Number: We start by asking the user to input a number.</p>
    <p>Initialize Variables: We set up two temporary variables: Temp and Reverse.
        <ul>
            <li>Temp stores the original number for comparison later.</li>
            <li>Reverse will store the digits of the number in reverse order.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Reverse the Number: We use a loop to reverse the digits of the number:
        <ul>
            <li>In each iteration of the loop, we take the last digit of the number using the operation Remainder = Number % 10.</li>
            <li>We then add this digit to the Reverse variable after shifting the existing digits to the left (Reverse = Reverse * 10 + Remainder).</li>
            <li>After adding the last digit to Reverse, we remove that digit from the original number (Number = Number / 10). We continue this process until all digits are reversed.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Check Palindrome: After reversing all digits, we compare the original number (Temp) with the reversed number (Reverse):
        <ul>
            <li>If they are equal, it means the number is the same when read forwards and backwards, so we display "Palindrome".</li>
            <li>If they are not equal, it means the number is not the same when read forwards and backwards, so we display "Not a Palindrome".</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>So, in simple terms, this code takes a number, flips it around, and then checks if the flipped number is the same as the original number. If it is, then the original number is a palindrome; if not, it's not a palindrome.</p>

        <h2>Assignment on Iteration in Pseudo-code - Level 2</h2>
        <p>A three digit number is said to be an “Armstrong number” if the sum of the third power of its individual digits is equal to the number itself.</p>
        <p>Example: <br>
            371 is an Armstrong number as 371 = 3<sup>3</sup> + 7<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup><br>
            407 is an Armstrong number as 407 = 4<sup>3</sup> + 0<sup>3</sup> + 7<sup>3</sup>
        </p>
        <p>Write a pseudo-code to check whether a given three-digit number is an Armstrong number.</p>
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Explanation of Armstrong Number</h2>
        <p><strong>What is an Armstrong Number?</strong> An Armstrong number is a special kind of number where the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits equals the original number itself.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> For example, take the number 371. It has three digits. Each digit (3, 7, and 1) raised to the power of three (the total number of digits) equals: 3<sup>3</sup> + 7<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup> = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371, which is the original number. So, 371 is an Armstrong number.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Check for Armstrong Number:</strong> To check if a given three-digit number is an Armstrong number, we need to split the number into its individual digits, raise each digit to the power of three, sum them up, and then see if the result equals the original number.</p>
        <p><strong>Pseudo-code:</strong> So, in pseudo-code, we'll input the number, calculate the sum of cubes of its digits, and compare it with the original number. If they are equal, then the given number is an Armstrong number; if not, it's not an Armstrong number.</p>

        <h2>Pseudo-code Explanation for Armstrong Number</h2>

        <p><strong>Initialize Variables:</strong> We set up two variables: Temp and Sum.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Temp stores the original number for comparison later.</li>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Calculate Sum of Cubes:</strong> We enter a loop that continues until the number becomes 0.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In each iteration of the loop, we extract the last digit of the number using the operation Remainder = Number % 10.</li>
            <li>We then calculate the cube of this digit and add it to the Sum: Sum = Sum + Remainder * Remainder * Remainder.</li>
            <li>After processing the last digit, we remove it from the original number by dividing Number by 10: Number = Number / 10.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Check for Armstrong Number:</strong> After processing all the digits, we compare the sum of cubes (Sum) with the original number (Temp).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If they are equal, we display "This is an Armstrong Number", indicating that the original number meets the criteria for an Armstrong number.</li>
            <li>If they are not equal, we display "This is not an Armstrong Number".</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, in simpler terms, this code checks if the sum of the cubes of the digits of a three-digit number is equal to the original number itself. If it is, then the number is an Armstrong number; if not, it's not an Armstrong number.</p>

    <li>Diffuser Check: If there's neither a path ahead nor a left turn available, we check if a diffuser is found. If so, the character diffuses the bombs, unlocks the lock, and checks if a key is found. If a key is found, the lock is unlocked again.</li>
    <li>The loop continues until the character reaches the ending point.</li>
  </ul>
     <p>Here's a simpler explanation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Loop until Destination Reached: We start a loop that keeps running until the character reaches the destination (E).</li>
    <li>Check Path Ahead: In each loop iteration, the character checks if there's a clear path ahead. If there is, the character moves forward.</li>
    <li>Turn Left if No Path Ahead: If there's no clear path ahead, the character checks if it can turn left. If it can, it does so.</li>
    <li>Diffuse Bombs and Unlock Locks: If there's neither a path ahead nor a left turn available, it means there might be bombs to diffuse. The character diffuses the bombs, unlocks any locks it finds, and checks if there's a key. If there's a key, it unlocks the lock again.</li>
    <li>Repeat Until Destination Reached: The character keeps looping through these steps until it reaches the destination.</li>

    <li>Left Turn Check: If there's no clear path ahead, the character checks if it's possible to turn left. If turning left is an option, the character makes a left turn.</li>
    <li>Diffuser Check: If there's neither a clear path ahead nor a left turn available, it suggests that there might be a bomb to diffuse. So, the character checks if it has found a bomb diffuser. If it has, the character proceeds to diffuse the bombs.</li>

    <h2>Flow of Execution in Functions</h2>
    <p>Let's analyze the given code to observe the flow of execution in functions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Function call:</strong> The code calls a function with certain arguments.</li>
        <li><strong>Copying Actual arguments to Formal arguments:</strong> The arguments passed to the function (actual arguments) are copied to the parameters defined in the function definition (formal arguments).</li>
        <li><strong>Execution of function body:</strong> Inside the function, the statements within the function body are executed using the values of the formal arguments.</li>
        <li><strong>Return from function:</strong> After executing the function body, the function returns a value (if specified) to the caller.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="container">
    <h2>Flow of Execution in Functions</h2>
    <p>Let's break down the flow of execution in functions step by step:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Function Call:</strong> The process starts with a function call. In the code, this is where we call the function with certain arguments. For example, calculate_total_ticket_cost(5, 2) is a function call where we're passing 5 adults and 2 children as arguments to the function.</li>
        <li><strong>Actual Arguments being Copied to Formal Arguments:</strong> When the function is called, the values passed as arguments (in this case, 5 and 2) are copied into the formal parameters of the function (in this case, no_of_adults and no_of_children). These formal parameters act as placeholders for the values that are passed to the function.</li>
        <li><strong>Execution of Function Body:</strong> Once the values are copied into the formal parameters, the function body is executed. This is where the actual computation takes place. In the code provided, the function calculates the total ticket cost, service tax, applies a discount, and calculates the final ticket cost after discount.</li>
        <li><strong>Return from Function:</strong> After the function body is executed, the function returns a value. This value can be used in the calling code. In this case, the function returns the total ticket cost after applying the discount.</li>

    <p>Execution Result

Output:
Passport is valid</p>
   <pre><code class="python">

 Let's go through the code step by step and explain it using the temporary variables observe1, observe2, observe3, observe4, observe5, and observe6:

    observe1: This variable holds the string "What's happening!!". It's just a placeholder to help us understand what's happening in the code.

    observe2: This variable holds the string "function with formal arg.". It's another placeholder to indicate that we're defining a function with formal parameters.

    observe3: This variable holds the string "calling with actual arg.". It's used to indicate that we're calling the function with actual arguments.

    observe4: This variable holds the string "actual copied to formal". It's used to indicate that the actual arguments passed to the function are copied into the formal parameters.

    observe5: This variable holds the string "func. execution starts". It's used to indicate the start of the execution of the function body.

    observe6: This variable holds the string "func. execution ends". It's used to indicate the end of the execution of the function body.

Now, let's break down the code execution using these temporary variables:

    We define a function named passport_check that takes one parameter passport_no.
    Inside the function:
        The variable observe4 is assigned the string "actual copied to formal" to indicate the copying of actual arguments to formal parameters.
        The variable observe5 is assigned the string "func. execution starts" to indicate the start of the function execution.
        The function checks if the length of the passport number is 8 characters and if the first character is a capital letter.
        Depending on the conditions, it sets the status variable to either "valid" or "invalid".
        The variable observe6 is assigned the string "func. execution ends" to indicate the end of the function execution.
        The function returns the value of the status variable.
    Outside the function:
        We call the passport_check function with the passport number "M9993471".
        The return value from the function is stored in the variable passport_status.
    Finally, we print the passport status using the print statement.

In summary, the temporary variables observe1 to observe6 help us understand the flow of the code execution, from defining the function to calling it and executing its body. They act as markers to indicate key points in the code execution process.

     <h2>Explanation of Code Snippets</h2>

    <h3>Code 1:</h3>
    <p>
        This code defines a function <code>func1</code> that takes two parameters <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and returns their sum.
        The function is called with arguments 5 and 10, and the returned value is stored in the variable <code>res</code>.
        The value returned by the function (sum of 5 and 10) is printed.
    </p>

    <h3>Code 2:</h3>
    <p>
        This code defines a function <code>func2</code> that doesn't take any parameters.
        Inside the function, it prints a message indicating that the code has nothing to return, but it still includes a return statement with no value.
        The function <code>func2</code> is called, and it prints the message defined inside the function.
        However, since there's no explicit return value, the function returns None, which is not printed.
    </p>

    <h3>Code 3:</h3>
    <p>
        This code defines a function <code>func3</code> that also doesn't take any parameters.
        Inside the function, it prints a message indicating that there is no return statement.
        The function <code>func3</code> is called, and it prints the message defined inside the function.
        Similar to Code 2, there's no explicit return value, so the function returns None, which is not printed.
    </p>

    <h3>Code 4:</h3>
    <p>
        This code defines a function <code>func4</code> that takes two parameters <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
        Inside the function, there's a conditional statement that checks if <code>a</code> is greater than <code>b</code>.
        If the condition is true, it prints a message and returns the value of <code>a</code>.
        If the condition is false, it prints another message and returns the value of <code>b</code>.
        Two invocations of the function <code>func4</code> are made with different arguments, and the returned values are printed.

     <h2>Breakdown of Code Snippets</h2>
    <h3>Code 1:</h3>
    <p>
        This code defines a function func6 that takes three parameters a, b, and c.
        Inside the function, it calculates the average of the three numbers (a + b + c) / 3 and returns this value.
        In the first invocation of func6, the returned value is not assigned to any variable, so it's calculated but not stored or used.
        In the second invocation, the returned value is assigned to a variable named average, and this value is printed.
        In the third invocation, the returned value is directly printed without assigning it to any variable.
    </p>
    <h3>Code 2:</h3>
    <p>
        This code defines a function func7 that takes two parameters a and b.
        Inside the function, there's a conditional statement that checks if a is greater than b. If it is, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
        In the first invocation of func7, x is 5 and y is 6. Since x is not greater than y, the function returns False, and the output "inside else block" is printed.
        In the second invocation, x is 6 and y is 5. Since x is greater than y, the function returns True, and the output "inside if block" is printed.

 <h2>Control Structures in Programming</h2>
    <p>
        Control structures are used by programmers to specify the order of execution of statements in a program.
        The commonly used control structures in programming include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> Statements are executed in a sequential order, one after the other.</li>
        <li><strong>Selection:</strong> Allows the program to execute different statements based on certain conditions. Examples include if statements, switch statements, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Allows the program to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a specified condition is met. Examples include for loops, while loops, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Jump:</strong> Allows the program to transfer control to another part of the program. Examples include break, continue, return statements, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Selection Control Structures - Airport Check-in Process</h2>
    <p>Below is the Python program representing the check-in process:</p>
    <p>In this Python program, there's a function check_luggage_weight that takes the luggage weight as input. If the luggage weight is less than or equal to 20, it prints "Luggage weight is within limit". Otherwise, it calculates the extra luggage weight and prints "Extra luggage weight is" followed by the weight of the extra luggage.

Then, the program calls this function with different luggage weights - 15, 25, and 30.

Let's go through it step by step:

    For the first call with luggage weight 15, it's within the limit, so "Luggage weight is within limit" is printed.
    For the second call with luggage weight 25, it's over the limit by 5 units, so "Extra luggage weight is 5" is printed.
    For the third call with luggage weight 30, it's over the limit by 10 units, so "Extra luggage weight is 10" is printed.</p>
    <pre><code>
ticket_status="Confirmed"
luggage_weight=32
weight_limit=30  #Weight limit for the airline
extra_luggage_charge=0
if(ticket_status=="Confirmed"):
    if(luggage_weight>0 and luggage_weight<=weight_limit):
        print("Check-in cleared")
    elif(luggage_weight<=(weight_limit+10)):
        extra_luggage_charge=300*(luggage_weight-weight_limit)
    else:
        extra_luggage_charge=500*(luggage_weight-weight_limit)
    if(extra_luggage_charge>0):
        print("Extra luggage charge is Rs.", extra_luggage_charge)
        print("Please make the payment to clear check-in")
else:
    print("Sorry, ticket is not confirmed")
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now, let's analyze the code and guess the output:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>ticket_status</code> is set to "Confirmed".</li>
        <li>The <code>luggage_weight</code> is set to 32, and the <code>weight_limit</code> is set to 30.</li>
        <li>Based on the conditions in the code:
            <ul>
                <li>Since the <code>ticket_status</code> is "Confirmed", the code proceeds to check the luggage weight.</li>
                <li>The luggage weight exceeds the weight limit, so the passenger needs to pay an extra luggage charge.</li>
                <li>The extra luggage charge is calculated based on the excess weight. Since the excess weight is 2 kg, which is within the range of 0-10 kg, the charge is calculated as Rs. 300 per kg.</li>
                <li>The calculated extra luggage charge is Rs. 600 (2 kg * Rs. 300/kg).</li>
                <li>The program prints "Extra luggage charge is Rs. 600" and "Please make the payment to clear check-in".</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
     <h2>Breakdown of Airport Check-in Process Code</h2>
    <p>Let's break down the code step by step:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We have a variable <code>ticket_status</code> which indicates whether the ticket is confirmed or not. It's set to "Confirmed".</li>
        <li>We have another variable <code>luggage_weight</code> which stores the weight of the luggage. It's set to 32.</li>
        <li><code>weight_limit</code> is the weight limit for the airline, set to 30.</li>
        <li><code>extra_luggage_charge</code> is initially set to 0.</li>
        <li>We start with a conditional check to see if the ticket status is "Confirmed".</li>
        <li>Inside the first <code>if</code> block, we check if the luggage weight is within the allowed limit (greater than 0 and less than or equal to <code>weight_limit</code>). If it is, we print "Check-in cleared".</li>
        <li>If the luggage weight exceeds the weight limit but is within 10 units over the limit, we calculate the extra luggage charge as 300 times the excess weight.</li>
        <li>If the luggage weight exceeds the weight limit by more than 10 units, we calculate the extra luggage charge as 500 times the excess weight.</li>
        <li>If there's any extra luggage charge calculated (i.e., <code>extra_luggage_charge > 0</code>), we print the extra luggage charge along with a message to make the payment to clear check-in.</li>
        <li>If the ticket status is not "Confirmed", we print "Sorry, ticket is not confirmed".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, if the ticket is confirmed and the luggage weight exceeds the limit, the code calculates and prints the extra luggage charge. Otherwise, it prints "Check-in cleared". If the ticket is not confirmed, it prints "Sorry, ticket is not confirmed".</p>
   <h2>Exploring Check-in Process: Passport Status</h2>
    <p>One of the first steps during the check-in process is checking the passport status. Consider the below program written for that:</p>
    <pre><code>
        passenger_name = "Chan"
        passport_status = "valid"
        if(passport_status == "valid"):
            print("Airport security cleared")
        else:
            print("Invalid passport")
    </code></pre>
    <p>The conditional statement used in this program is known as an if-else statement.</p>
        <h2>Exploring Check-in Process: Luggage Weight</h2>
    <p>The next step in the check-in process is checking the luggage weight. Consider the below program written for that:</p>
    <pre><code>
        luggage_weight = 30
        weight_limit = 30  # Weight limit for the airline
        extra_luggage_charge = 0
        if(luggage_weight > 0 and luggage_weight <= weight_limit):
            print("Check-in cleared")
        elif(luggage_weight <= (weight_limit + 10)):
            extra_luggage_charge = 300 * (luggage_weight - weight_limit)
        else:
            extra_luggage_charge = 500 * (luggage_weight - weight_limit)
        if(extra_luggage_charge > 0):
            print("Extra luggage charge is Rs.", extra_luggage_charge)
            print("Please make the payment to clear check-in")
    </code></pre>
    <p>The conditional statement in this program is known as the else if ladder. The conditions are evaluated from the top of the ladder downwards. As soon as a true condition is encountered, the statement associated with it is executed. The remaining condition checks in the ladder will be skipped.</p>
      <h2>Check-in Process: Luggage Weight</h2>
    <p>During the check-in process, the luggage weight is checked against the weight limit for the airline. Here's the Python code for this process:</p>
    <pre><code>
        luggage_weight = 30
        weight_limit = 30  # Weight limit for the airline
        extra_luggage_charge = 0
        if(luggage_weight > 0 and luggage_weight <= weight_limit):
            print("Check-in cleared")
        elif(luggage_weight <= (weight_limit + 10)):
            extra_luggage_charge = 300 * (luggage_weight - weight_limit)
        else:
            extra_luggage_charge = 500 * (luggage_weight - weight_limit)
        if(extra_luggage_charge > 0):
            print("Extra luggage charge is Rs.", extra_luggage_charge)
            print("Please make the payment to clear check-in")
    </code></pre>
    <p>This code checks the luggage weight against the weight limit. If the weight is within the limit, the check-in is cleared. If the weight exceeds the limit but is within 10 units over the limit, an extra luggage charge of Rs. 300 per unit is applied. If the weight exceeds the limit by more than 10 units, an extra luggage charge of Rs. 500 per unit is applied.</p>
      <h2>Check-in Process: Airlines</h2>
    <p>Considering the check-in process for various airlines, the code is structured to optimize execution time by ordering conditions based on the frequency of occurrence of airlines:</p>
    <h3>Code 1:</h3>
    <pre><code>
        airline = "AirIndia"
        if(airline == "AirIndia"):
            print("Proceed to Air India check-in counter")
        elif(airline == "Emirates"):
            print("Proceed to Emirates check-in counter")
        elif(airline == "British Airways"):
            print("Proceed to British Airways check-in counter")
        else:
            print("Invalid airline")
    </code></pre>
    <p>This code prioritizes Air India as it's the most commonly used airline, followed by Emirates and British Airways. This ordering minimizes the number of comparisons needed, optimizing execution time.</p>
     <h2>Check-in Process: Ticket Validation and Luggage Check-in</h2>
    <p>In the check-in process, ticket validation occurs first, followed by luggage check-in. The code below demonstrates this process using nested if statements:</p>
    <pre><code>
        ticket_status="Confirmed"
        luggage_weight=32
        weight_limit=30  #Weight limit for the airline
        extra_luggage_charge=0
        if(ticket_status=="Confirmed"):
            if(luggage_weight>0 and luggage_weight<=weight_limit):
                print("Check-in cleared")
            elif(luggage_weight<=(weight_limit+10)):
                extra_luggage_charge=300*(luggage_weight-weight_limit)
            else:
                extra_luggage_charge=500*(luggage_weight-weight_limit)
            if(extra_luggage_charge>0):
                print("Extra luggage charge is Rs.", extra_luggage_charge)
                print("Please make the payment to clear check-in")
        else:
            print("Sorry, ticket is not confirmed")
    </code></pre>
    <p>This code demonstrates the use of nested if statements where ticket validation is nested within luggage check-in. Depending on the ticket status, appropriate actions are taken to clear the check-in process.</p>

      <h1>Let's break down the problem statement:</h1>

<p>The provided code likely includes an if-else statement that checks whether the airport security has cleared and calculates the extra luggage charge if applicable. However, there seems to be an issue with the code as the expected output is not being generated.</P>

<p>To fix the issue and get the desired output, you need to identify and correct any errors or logical flaws in the code. This may involve adjusting the conditions within the if-else statement or making changes to how the extra luggage charge is calculated.</p>

<p>Once the necessary corrections are made, the code should produce the expected output, which includes a message indicating that the airport security has been cleared and another message specifying the extra luggage charge along with a request to make the payment to clear the check-in.</p>


  <h1>Let's break down the provided code step by step:</h1>

      <p>passport_status="valid": This line initializes the variable passport_status with the value "valid", indicating that the passport status is valid.</p>

   <p> ticket_status="Confirmed": This line initializes the variable ticket_status with the value "Confirmed", indicating that the ticket status is confirmed.</p>

    <p>luggage_weight=32: This line initializes the variable luggage_weight with the value 32, representing the weight of the luggage.</p>

    <p>weight_limit=30: This line initializes the variable weight_limit with the value 30, which represents the weight limit for the airline.</p>

   <p> extra_luggage_charge=0: This line initializes the variable extra_luggage_charge with the value 0, which will store the extra luggage charge if applicable.</p>

   <p> if(passport_status=="valid"):
        Checks if the passport status is valid.
        If it is valid, proceeds to the next step; otherwise, prints "Invalid passport".</p>

    <p>print("Airport security cleared"): Prints "Airport security cleared" to indicate that the airport security check has been cleared.</p>

    <p>Nested if statement:
        if(ticket_status=="Confirmed"):
            Checks if the ticket status is confirmed.
            If confirmed, proceeds to luggage weight check; otherwise, proceeds to the else block.</p>

   <p> Nested if-else statement:
        if(luggage_weight>0 and luggage_weight<=weight_limit):
            Checks if the luggage weight is within the allowed limit.
            If within the limit, prints "Check-in cleared".
            If not within the limit, proceeds to calculate the extra luggage charge.</p>

    <p>Nested else block:
        else:
            Calculates the extra luggage charge based on the weight exceeding the limit.
            Checks if the extra luggage charge is greater than 0.
            If so, prints the extra luggage charge and a request to make the payment to clear check-in.
            If not, prints "Sorry, ticket is not confirmed".</p>

<p>This code ensures that the airport security is cleared, validates the passport and ticket status, checks the luggage weight, and calculates the extra luggage charge if applicable. It provides appropriate messages based on the conditions met.</p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Code Breakdown</h2>
        <h3>Function Definition</h3>
        <p><strong>Function Signature:</strong></p>
        <pre>
def find_product(num1, num2, num3):
        </pre>
        <p>This line defines a function named <code>find_product</code> that takes three parameters: <code>num1</code>, <code>num2</code>, and <code>num3</code>.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Create a List of Numbers</h3>
        <p><strong>Creating a List:</strong></p>
        <pre>
nums = [num1, num2, num3]
        </pre>
        <p>This line creates a list called <code>nums</code> containing the three input numbers.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Check for 7 and Slice the List</h3>
        <p><strong>Checking for 7:</strong></p>
        <pre>
if 7 in nums:
    index = nums.index(7) + 1
    nums = nums[index:]
        </pre>
        <p>
            <code>if 7 in nums:</code> This line checks if the number 7 is in the list <code>nums</code>.<br>
            <code>index = nums.index(7) + 1:</code> If 7 is found, it finds the index of 7 in the list and adds 1 to it, which gives the position of the element right after 7.<br>
            <code>nums = nums[index:]:</code> This line slices the list to start from the position right after 7, effectively removing 7 and all elements to its left from the list.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3: Handle the Case Where No Numbers Remain</h3>
        <p><strong>Check for Empty List:</strong></p>
        <pre>
if not nums:
    return -1
        </pre>
        <p>
            <code>if not nums:</code> This line checks if the list <code>nums</code> is empty (i.e., there are no numbers left in the list).<br>
            <code>return -1:</code> If the list is empty, the function returns -1 because there are no numbers to multiply.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4: Calculate the Product</h3>
        <p><strong>Calculate the Product:</strong></p>
        <pre>
product = 1
for num in nums:
    product *= num
        </pre>
        <p>
            <code>product = 1:</code> Initializes a variable <code>product</code> to 1.<br>
            <code>for num in nums:</code> This line starts a loop that iterates over each number in the list <code>nums</code>.<br>
            <code>product *= num:</code> For each number in the list, it multiplies <code>product</code> by that number.

        <h3>Step 5: Return the Result</h3>
        <p><strong>Return the Product:</strong></p>
        <pre>
return product

        <p>This line returns the final product of the numbers left in the list after processing.</p>

        <h3>Example Test Cases</h3>
        <p><strong>Test Cases:</strong></p>
        <pre>
print(find_product(1, 5, 3))  # Expected output: 15
print(find_product(3, 7, 8))  # Expected output: 8
print(find_product(7, 4, 3))  # Expected output: 12
print(find_product(1, 5, 7))  # Expected output: -1
        </pre>
        <p>
            These lines test the function with different inputs and print the results:<br>
            <code>find_product(1, 5, 3):</code> No 7, so the product is 1 * 5 * 3 = 15.<br>
            <code>find_product(3, 7, 8):</code> 7 is present, so only 8 is considered. Output is 8.<br>
            <code>find_product(7, 4, 3):</code> 7 is present, so only 4 and 3 are considered. Output is 4 * 3 = 12.<br>
            <code>find_product(1, 5, 7):</code> 7 is present, no numbers left after 7. Output is -1.
        </p>
        <p>This code handles the specific rule about excluding 7 and numbers to its left, calculates the product of the remaining numbers, and returns the appropriate result based on the conditions given.</p>

        <h1>Triangle Check</h1>
        <p>Write a Python function to check whether three given numbers can form the sides of a triangle.</p>
        <p><strong>Hint:</strong> Three numbers can be the sides of a triangle if none of the numbers are greater than or equal to the sum of the other two numbers.</p>
     <h2>Problem Explanation</h2>
        <p>You're asked to write a Python function that checks whether three given numbers can form the sides of a triangle.</p>
        <h3>Conditions for a Triangle:</h3>
        <p><strong>Triangle Inequality Theorem:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>None of the three numbers should be greater than or equal to the sum of the other two numbers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Function Objective</h2>
        <p>Your function needs to determine if the given three numbers satisfy this condition, indicating whether they can form a triangle.</p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>For example, if you have three numbers: 3, 4, and 5:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 is less than the sum of 4 and 5 (3 &lt; 4 + 5), so it can be a side of a triangle.</li>
            <li>Similarly, 4 is less than the sum of 3 and 5 (4 &lt; 3 + 5), and 5 is less than the sum of 3 and 4 (5 &lt; 3 + 4).</li>
            <li>So, the numbers 3, 4, and 5 can form the sides of a triangle.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Function Implementation</h2>
        <p>Your Python function should take three numbers as input and return either True if they can form a triangle or False if they cannot.</p>
        <h2>Constraints</h2>
        <p>You may assume that the input consists of three positive integers.</p>
         <h2>Explanation of the Code</h2>
        <pre>
            <code>
                def form_triangle(num1, num2, num3):
                    # Do not change the messages provided below
                    success = "Triangle can be formed"
                    failure = "Triangle can't be formed"

                    # Check if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side
                    if num1 + num2 > num3 and num1 + num3 > num2 and num2 + num3 > num1:
                        return success
                    else:
                        return failure

                # Provide different values for the variables, num1, num2, num3 and test your program
                num1 = 3
                num2 = 4
                num3 = 5
                print(form_triangle(num1, num2, num3))
            </code>
        </pre>
        <h3>Explanation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Function Definition:</strong> The code defines a function named <code>form_triangle</code> that takes three parameters: <code>num1</code>, <code>num2</code>, and <code>num3</code>.</li>

            <li><strong>Message Definitions:</strong> It defines two messages: <code>success</code> for when a triangle can be formed and <code>failure</code> for when it can't.</li>

            <li><strong>Triangle Formation Check:</strong> It checks whether the sum of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the third side. If this condition is true for all combinations of sides, it means a triangle can be formed.</li>

            <li><strong>Return Statements:</strong> It returns the appropriate message based on the result of the triangle formation check. If the condition is true, it returns the success message; otherwise, it returns the failure message.</li>

            <li><strong>Function Invocation:</strong> Finally, it calls the <code>form_triangle</code> function with the values of <code>num1</code>, <code>num2</code>, and <code>num3</code> as arguments and prints the result of the function call.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Function Definition:</strong> The function <code>make_amount</code> takes three arguments:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>rupees_to_make</code>: The total amount of rupees you want to make/change.</li>
                    <li><code>no_of_five</code>: The number of 5 rupee coins you have.</li>
                    <li><code>no_of_one</code>: The number of 1 rupee coins you have.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Variable Initialization:</strong> Two variables, <code>five_needed</code> and <code>one_needed</code>, are initialized to 0. These variables will store the number of 5 rupee coins and 1 rupee coins needed, respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Calculate 5 Rupee Coins Needed:</strong> The code calculates the maximum number of 5 rupee coins that can be used to make the given amount. It divides the <code>rupees_to_make</code> by 5 (integer division) and takes the minimum of this result and the number of 5 rupee coins available (<code>no_of_five</code>). This ensures that you don't use more 5 rupee coins than you have.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Calculate Remaining Amount:</strong> After using the 5 rupee coins, the code calculates the remaining amount of rupees that need to be covered with 1 rupee coins.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Calculate 1 Rupee Coins Needed:</strong> If the remaining amount can be covered with the available 1 rupee coins (<code>remaining_amount &lt;= no_of_one</code>), it calculates the number of 1 rupee coins needed (<code>one_needed</code>). If not, it prints -1 and returns from the function because it's not possible to make the required amount with the available coins.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Print the Result:</strong> Finally, it prints the number of 5 rupee coins and 1 rupee coins needed to make the desired amount.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
         <h2>Detailed Explanation of Specific Line of Code:</h2>
        <p>This line of code calculates the maximum number of 5 rupee coins that can be used to make the desired amount. Let's break it down:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>rupees_to_make // 5</code>: This part of the code divides the total amount of rupees (<code>rupees_to_make</code>) by 5 using integer division (<code>//</code>). Integer division returns the quotient without any remainder. So, this calculation gives us the maximum number of 5 rupee coins that can be used without exceeding the total amount.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>no_of_five</code>: This is the actual number of 5 rupee coins you have.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>min(...)</code>: The <code>min()</code> function is used here to find the minimum of the two values calculated above. This ensures that you don't use more 5 rupee coins than you have. Even if the calculation <code>rupees_to_make // 5</code> gives a result larger than the number of 5 rupee coins you have (<code>no_of_five</code>), <code>min(...)</code> ensures that you only use as many 5 rupee coins as you actually possess.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, <code>five_needed</code> stores the maximum number of 5 rupee coins that can be used to make the desired amount, considering both the amount needed and the number of 5 rupee coins available. This ensures that you use the available coins optimally without exceeding your resources.</p>
     <h2>Detailed Explanation of Remaining Amount Calculation:</h2>
        <p>The <code>remaining_amount</code> variable tells you how much more money you need to make up using the 1 rupee coins after you have used as many 5 rupee coins as possible.</p>
        <p>In summary, this line subtracts the total value of the 5 rupee coins used from the total amount you need to make, giving you the amount that still needs to be made up with 1 rupee coins.</p>
        <p>Here’s a step-by-step explanation with the given example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You need to make 21 rupees.</li>
            <li>You can use up to 4 five rupee coins (since 21 divided by 5 is 4.2, and you can only use whole coins).</li>
            <li>The total value of the 4 five rupee coins is <code>4 × 5 = 20</code> rupees.</li>
            <li>Subtract this from the total amount needed: <code>21 - 20 = 1</code>.</li>
            <li>So, you still need 1 rupee, which can be made up with a 1 rupee coin.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This calculation ensures you know exactly how much more is needed after using the larger denomination coins.</p>
          <h2>Step-by-Step Explanation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose of This Block:</strong> This block of code calculates how many 1 rupee coins are needed to make up the remaining amount after using as many 5 rupee coins as possible. It also checks if you have enough 1 rupee coins to cover the remaining amount.</li>
            <li><strong>Variables:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>remaining_amount</code>: The amount of money still needed after using the 5 rupee coins.</li>
                    <li><code>no_of_one</code>: The number of 1 rupee coins available.</li>
                    <li><code>one_needed</code>: The number of 1 rupee coins required to make the remaining amount.</li>
                </ul>

                        <code>if remaining_amount &lt;= no_of_one:</code>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> This line checks if the remaining amount you need (after using the 5 rupee coins) is less than or equal to the number of 1 rupee coins you have.</li>
                            <li><strong>Why it's important:</strong> This check ensures that you have enough 1 rupee coins to make up the remaining amount. If you don't have enough 1 rupee coins, you won't be able to provide the exact change.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>one_needed = remaining_amount</code>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> If the condition in the previous line is true (i.e., you have enough 1 rupee coins), this line sets the number of 1 rupee coins needed to the remaining amount.</li>
                            <li><strong>Why it's important:</strong> This line assigns the exact number of 1 rupee coins needed to make up the remaining amount to the variable <code>one_needed</code>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What it does:</strong> If the condition in the first line is not true (i.e., you don't have enough 1 rupee coins), this block of code executes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Why it's important:</strong> This part of the code handles the scenario where you can't provide the exact change because you don't have enough 1 rupee coins.</li>
                            <li><strong>What happens:</strong> It prints -1 to indicate that providing the exact change is not possible, and then <code>return</code> is used to exit the function early.</li>

        <h2>FoodCorner Delivery Bill Calculation</h2>
        <p>FoodCorner offers home delivery of vegetarian and non-vegetarian combos to its customers. The cost per plate for a vegetarian combo is Rs. 120, and for a non-vegetarian combo, it's Rs. 150.</p>
        <p>Customers are also charged for home delivery based on the distance in kilometers from the restaurant to the delivery point. The delivery charges are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For the first 3 kilometers: Rs. 0 per kilometer</li>
            <li>For the next 3 kilometers (up to 6 kilometers): Rs. 3 per kilometer</li>
            <li>For distances beyond 6 kilometers: Rs. 6 per kilometer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following information must be used to check the validity of the data provided by the customer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Type of food must be 'V' for vegetarian and 'N' for non-vegetarian.</li>
            <li>Distance in kilometers must be greater than 0.</li>
            <li>Quantity ordered should be minimum 1.</li>
            <li>If any of the input is invalid, the bill amount should be considered as -1.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Problem Explanation in Simple English</h2>
        <p>You need to write a Python program for a food delivery service that calculates the final bill amount a customer needs to pay based on the type of food ordered, the quantity of food, and the distance for delivery. Here's how it works:</p>
        <h3>Types of Food:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetarian combo (type 'V'): Costs Rs.120 per plate.</li>
            <li>Non-vegetarian combo (type 'N'): Costs Rs.150 per plate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Delivery Charges Based on Distance:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The first 3 kilometers: Free delivery.</li>
            <li>From 4 to 6 kilometers: Rs.3 per kilometer.</li>
            <li>Beyond 6 kilometers: Rs.6 per kilometer.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conditions for Valid Input:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Type of food must be either 'V' (vegetarian) or 'N' (non-vegetarian).</li>
            <li>Distance must be greater than 0 kilometers.</li>
            <li>Quantity of food must be at least 1 plate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Output:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If any input is invalid, the program should return -1.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the program should calculate and return the total bill amount.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Detailed Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Input Validation:
                <ul>
                    <li>Check if the food type is valid ('V' or 'N').</li>
                    <li>Check if the distance is greater than 0.</li>
                    <li>Check if the quantity is at least 1.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Calculate the Food Cost: Multiply the number of plates by the cost per plate (Rs.120 for 'V' and Rs.150 for 'N').</li>
            <li>Calculate the Delivery Charges:
                <ul>
                    <li>First 3 kilometers are free.</li>
                    <li>For distance between 4 to 6 kilometers, charge Rs.3 per kilometer.</li>
                    <li>For distance beyond 6 kilometers, charge Rs.6 per kilometer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Calculate the Total Bill: Add the food cost and the delivery charges.</li>
            <li>Return the Total Bill or -1 for invalid inputs.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>Let's say a customer orders 2 non-vegetarian combos and the distance is 7 kilometers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Food type: 'N'</li>
            <li>Quantity: 2</li>
            <li>Distance: 7 kilometers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Calculation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Food cost: 2 plates * Rs.150 = Rs.300</li>
            <li>Delivery charge:
                <ul>
                    <li>First 3 km: Rs.0</li>
                    <li>Next 3 km (4th to 6th km): 3 km * Rs.3 = Rs.9</li>
                    <li>Remaining 1 km (7th km): 1 km * Rs.6 = Rs.6</li>
                    <li>Total delivery charge: Rs.0 + Rs.9 + Rs.6 = Rs.15</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Total bill: Rs.300 (food) + Rs.15 (delivery) = Rs.315</li>
        </ul>

        <code><pre>

        <h2>Food Delivery Bill Calculation</h2>
        <h3>Input Part</h3>
        <p>The input part involves receiving three parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>food_type</code>: The type of food ('V' for vegetarian or 'N' for non-vegetarian).</li>
            <li><code>quantity_ordered</code>: The number of plates ordered.</li>
            <li><code>distance_in_kms</code>: The distance from the restaurant to the delivery point in kilometers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These inputs are passed to the function <code>calculate_bill_amount</code>.</p>

        <h3>Process Part</h3>
        <p>The process part involves several steps:</p>

        <h4>Validation of Inputs:</h4>
        <pre><code>if food_type not in ['V', 'N'] or quantity_ordered &lt; 1 or distance_in_kms &lt;= 0:
    return -1</code></pre>
        <p>This step checks if the inputs are valid:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <code>food_type</code> must be either 'V' or 'N'.</li>
            <li>The <code>quantity_ordered</code> must be at least 1.</li>
            <li>The <code>distance_in_kms</code> must be greater than 0.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns -1, indicating invalid input.</p>

        <h4>Calculate Food Cost:</h4>
        <pre><code>if food_type == 'V':
    food_cost_per_plate = 120
else:
    food_cost_per_plate = 150

food_cost = food_cost_per_plate * quantity_ordered</code></pre>
        <p>This step determines the cost per plate based on the type of food:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetarian combo costs Rs.120 per plate.</li>
            <li>Non-vegetarian combo costs Rs.150 per plate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The total food cost is calculated by multiplying the cost per plate by the number of plates ordered.</p>

        <h4>Calculate Delivery Charge:</h4>
        <pre><code>if distance_in_kms &lt;= 3:
    delivery_charge = 0
elif distance_in_kms &lt;= 6:
    delivery_charge = (distance_in_kms - 3) * 3
else:
    delivery_charge = (6 - 3) * 3 + (distance_in_kms - 6) * 6</code></pre>
        <p>This step calculates the delivery charge based on the distance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For the first 3 kilometers, the delivery is free (Rs.0).</li>
            <li>For the next 3 kilometers (4 to 6 km), the delivery charge is Rs.3 per kilometer.</li>
            <li>For any distance beyond 6 kilometers, the charge is Rs.6 per kilometer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Calculate Total Bill Amount:</h4>
        <pre><code>bill_amount = food_cost + delivery_charge</code></pre>
        <p>The total bill amount is the sum of the food cost and the delivery charge.</p>

        <h3>Output Part</h3>
        <p>The output part involves returning the calculated total bill amount:</p>
        <pre><code>return bill_amount</code></pre>
        <p>If the inputs were valid, this part returns the total bill amount calculated. If the inputs were invalid, the function returns -1 (as handled in the validation step).</p>

        <h2>Explanation of Input Validation</h2>
        <p>Let's break down the statement <code>if food_type not in ['V', 'N'] or quantity_ordered &lt; 1 or distance_in_kms &lt;= 0: return -1</code> in simple English.</p>

        <h3>Explanation</h3>

        <h4>Checking the Food Type:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><code>food_type not in ['V', 'N']</code></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This part checks if the <code>food_type</code> is either 'V' for vegetarian or 'N' for non-vegetarian.</li>
                <li>If <code>food_type</code> is neither 'V' nor 'N', this condition will be True.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h4>Checking the Quantity Ordered:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><code>quantity_ordered &lt; 1</code></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This part checks if the <code>quantity_ordered</code> is less than 1.</li>
                <li>If <code>quantity_ordered</code> is less than 1, this condition will be True.</li>
                <li>It ensures that at least one plate is ordered.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h4>Checking the Distance in Kilometers:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><code>distance_in_kms &lt;= 0</code></li>
            <ul>
                <li>This part checks if the <code>distance_in_kms</code> is less than or equal to 0.</li>
                <li>If <code>distance_in_kms</code> is less than or equal to 0, this condition will be True.</li>
                <li>It ensures that the distance for delivery is positive.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h4>Combining the Conditions with <code>or</code>:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The entire condition uses <code>or</code> to combine the three checks.</li>
            <li>This means if any one of the three conditions is True, the combined condition will be True.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Returning -1 for Invalid Input:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><code>return -1</code></li>
            <ul>
                <li>If any of the three conditions is True, the function returns -1.</li>
                <li>Returning -1 indicates that the input provided by the user is invalid.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Simple English Summary</h3>
        <p>
            If the type of food is not 'V' (vegetarian) or 'N' (non-vegetarian),<br>
            Or if the quantity ordered is less than 1,<br>
            Or if the distance is less than or equal to 0,<br>
            Then, the function will return -1 to indicate that the input is invalid.
        </p>

        <h3>Example Scenarios</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><code>(distance_in_kms - 6) * 6</code> calculates the charge for the remaining kilometers beyond 6 kilometers (6 rupees per kilometer).</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Simple English Summary</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the Distance is 3 Kms or Less:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The delivery charge is 0 rupees.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If the Distance is Between 3 and 6 Kms:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Calculate the delivery charge for the distance beyond the first 3 kilometers.</li>
                <li>Multiply the number of extra kilometers by 3 rupees per kilometer.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If the Distance is More Than 6 Kms:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>First, calculate the charge for the distance from 3 to 6 kilometers (3 rupees per kilometer for 3 kilometers).</li>
                <li>Then, calculate the charge for the distance beyond 6 kilometers (6 rupees per kilometer).</li>
                <li>Add these two amounts to get the total delivery charge.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Example Scenarios</h3>

        <h4>Distance is 2 Kms:</h4>
        <pre><code>python
distance_in_kms = 2
# delivery_charge = 0 (since distance <= 3)</code></pre>

        <h4>Distance is 5 Kms:</h4>
        <pre><code>python
distance_in_kms = 5
# delivery_charge = (5 - 3) * 3 = 2 * 3 = 6</code></pre>

        <h4>Distance is 8 Kms:</h4>

        <h2>Code Explanation</h2>

        <h3>Line: Calculate Total Bill Amount</h3>
        <pre><code>python
bill_amount = food_cost + delivery_charge</code></pre>
        <ul>
            <li>This line adds the food_cost and the delivery_charge to get the total amount the customer needs to pay.</li>
            <li><code>food_cost</code> is the total cost of the food items ordered.</li>
            <li><code>delivery_charge</code> is the cost for delivering the food to the customer's location.</li>
            <li>The sum of these two values is stored in the variable <code>bill_amount</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Line: Return the Total Bill Amount</h3>
        <pre><code>python
return bill_amount</code></pre>
        <ul>
            <li>This line returns the total bill amount calculated in the previous step.</li>
            <li>The function ends here, and the calculated <code>bill_amount</code> is given back to whatever called this function.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Simple English Summary</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Calculate Total Bill Amount:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the cost of the food items (<code>food_cost</code>) to the delivery charge (<code>delivery_charge</code>).</li>
                <li>Store this sum in the variable <code>bill_amount</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Return the Total Bill Amount:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Return the value stored in <code>bill_amount</code> as the result of the function.</li>
                <li>This is the total amount the customer has to pay.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Let's say the <code>food_cost</code> is 300 rupees and the <code>delivery_charge</code> is 21 rupees.</p>
        <h4>Calculate Total Bill Amount:</h4>
        <pre><code>python
bill_amount = food_cost + delivery_charge
bill_amount = 300 + 21
bill_amount = 321</code></pre>
        <h4>Return the Total Bill Amount:</h4>
        <pre><code>python
return 321</code></pre>
        <p>The function returns 321, which means the customer has to pay a total of 321 rupees for their order.</p>
        <p>So, this part of the code simply adds up the costs and provides the final amount to be paid.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Problem Explanation</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Input Variables:</strong><br>
            The program will initialize several input variables:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>account_number</code></li>
            <li><code>account_balance</code></li>
            <li><code>salary</code></li>
            <li><code>loan_type</code></li>
            <li><code>loan_amount_expected</code></li>
            <li><code>customer_emi_expected</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These variables will hold information such as the customer's account details, salary, expected loan details, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Account Number Rules:</strong><br>
            The account number should be a 4-digit number.<br>
            The first digit of the account number should be 1.<br>
            These rules ensure that the account number is valid and follows a specific format.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Minimum Balance Requirement:</strong><br>
            The customer should have a minimum balance of Rs. 1 Lakh (100,000) in their account.<br>
            This ensures that the customer has sufficient funds to be eligible for a loan.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Loan Eligibility Criteria:</strong><br>
            Based on the customer's salary and the type of loan they are interested in, the bank determines the eligible loan amount and the number of EMIs (Equated Monthly Installments) that can be offered.<br>
            Different loan types (Car, House, Business) have different eligibility criteria in terms of the maximum loan amount and the number of EMIs.<br>
            The bank will only provide the loan if the requested loan amount and the number of EMIs are within the limits set by the bank for that particular loan type.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Error Handling:</strong><br>
            If any of the input data provided by the customer is invalid or does not meet the bank's criteria, appropriate error messages should be displayed.<br>
            This ensures that the customer receives feedback about any incorrect or invalid inputs.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Display Output:</strong><br>
            If all the conditions are met and the customer is eligible for the loan, the program will display:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Account number</li>
            <li>Eligible loan amount</li>
            <li>Requested loan amount</li>
            <li>Number of EMIs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Simple English Summary:</h3>
        <p>
            The program takes input from the user, including account details, salary, expected loan details, etc. It checks if the inputs meet certain criteria, such as account number format, minimum account balance, and loan eligibility based on salary and loan type. If the inputs are valid and the customer is eligible for the loan, the program displays the account number, eligible loan amount, requested loan amount, and number of EMIs. If any inputs are invalid, appropriate error messages are displayed.
        </p>

        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>
            Suppose a customer has an account number 1234, a salary of Rs. 60,000, and wants a car loan of Rs. 400,000 to be repaid in 48 EMIs.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Input Variables:
                <ul>
                    <li>account_number: 1234</li>
                    <li>salary: 60,000</li>
                    <li>loan_type: Car</li>
                    <li>loan_amount_expected: 400,000</li>
                    <li>customer_emi_expected: 48</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Output:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Account number: 1234</li>
            <li>Eligible loan amount: 500,000</li>
            <li>Requested loan amount: 400,000</li>
            <li>Number of EMIs: 48</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This indicates that the customer is eligible for the requested loan amount and number of EMIs, and the loan can be provided.
        </p>
    </div>
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Program Logic</h2>
        <p>The logic of the program revolves around validating the input data provided by the customer and determining the eligibility for a loan based on predefined criteria set by the bank. Here's the logic step by step:</p>

        <h3>Input Validation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Check if the account number is a 4-digit number starting with 1.</li>
            <li>Verify if the account balance is at least Rs. 1 Lakh.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the salary is a valid amount.</li>
            <li>Validate the loan type to be one of the predefined options: Car, House, or Business.</li>
            <li>Confirm that the requested loan amount and the number of EMIs are valid.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Loan Eligibility:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Based on the loan type and salary, determine the eligible loan amount and the maximum number of EMIs allowed.</li>
            <li>Compare the requested loan amount and the number of EMIs with the eligible limits.</li>
            <li>If the requested loan amount and the number of EMIs are within the eligible limits, proceed; otherwise, display an error message.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Display Output:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If all input data are valid and the requested loan amount and number of EMIs are within the eligible limits, display the account number, eligible loan amount, requested loan amount, and number of EMIs.</li>
            <li>If any input data is invalid or the requested loan amount and number of EMIs exceed the eligible limits, display an appropriate error message.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Error Handling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If any input data is invalid or does not meet the bank's criteria, display an error message indicating the reason for the invalidity.</li>
            <li>This ensures that the customer receives feedback about any incorrect or invalid inputs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Output:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If all conditions are met and the customer is eligible for the loan, display the account number, eligible loan amount, requested loan amount, and number of EMIs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overall, the logic ensures that the input data are valid, checks the eligibility for the loan based on predefined criteria, handles any errors in the input data, and displays appropriate output or error messages accordingly.</p>

      <h1>Metro Bank Loan Eligibility Explanation</h1>
    <p>These lines of code initialize two variables, <code>eligible_loan_amount</code> and <code>bank_emi_expected</code>, with initial values of 0. Let's break down why this initialization is important:</p>

    <h2>Purpose of Initialization</h2>
    <h3>Eligible Loan Amount (<code>eligible_loan_amount</code>):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This variable will store the amount of loan the customer is eligible for based on their salary and the type of loan they want to avail.</li>
        <li><strong>Initialization to 0:</strong> It is initialized to 0 because, at the start of the program, we have not yet determined the customer's eligibility for any loan amount. This will be updated later in the program based on the provided input values and bank rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bank EMI Expected (<code>bank_emi_expected</code>):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This variable will store the number of EMIs (Equated Monthly Installments) that the bank is willing to provide for the eligible loan amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Initialization to 0:</strong> Similar to <code>eligible_loan_amount</code>, it is initialized to 0 because, initially, the bank has not committed to any number of EMIs for the customer. This will also be updated later in the program based on the customer's salary and the loan type.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Initialize to Zero?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Default Values:</strong> Initializing these variables to 0 gives them a defined default value, ensuring that they are not left undefined. This helps in avoiding errors when these variables are used later in the program.</li>
        <li><strong>Preparation for Conditions:</strong> As the program progresses, it will evaluate various conditions to assign appropriate values to these variables. Starting with a known default (0) makes it easier to set and compare values accurately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Usage in Context</h2>
    <p>Here's a simplified flow of how these variables might be used:</p>

    <h3>Check Eligibility Based on Salary and Loan Type:</h3>
    <pre>
<code>
if salary > 75000 and loan_type == "Business":
    eligible_loan_amount = 7500000
    bank_emi_expected = 84
elif salary > 50000 and loan_type == "House":
    eligible_loan_amount = 6000000
    bank_emi_expected = 60
elif salary > 25000 and loan_type == "Car":
    eligible_loan_amount = 500000
    bank_emi_expected = 36
</code>
    </pre>

    <h3>Compare Requested Loan and EMI with Eligible Amount and Bank EMI:</h3>
    <pre>
<code>
if loan_amount_expected <= eligible_loan_amount and customer_emi_expected <= bank_emi_expected:
    # Loan can be provided
    print("Account Number:", account_number)
    print("Eligible Loan Amount:", eligible_loan_amount)
    print("Requested Loan Amount:", loan_amount_expected)
    print("Number of EMIs:", customer_emi_expected)
else:
    print("Requested loan amount or EMI exceeds eligibility.")
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Initializing <code>eligible_loan_amount</code> and <code>bank_emi_expected</code> to 0 ensures that the program starts with a clean slate, avoids undefined variables, and prepares for accurate condition checking and updates based on the customer's details and bank's rules.</p>

    <h4>Purpose of This Code</h4>
    <p>
        This code snippet is used to validate the account number. It ensures that the account number meets the specified criteria:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The account number should be exactly 4 digits long.</li>
        <li>The first digit of the account number should be '1'.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Step-by-Step Explanation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Convert Account Number to String:</strong></li>
        <pre><code>str(account_number)</code></pre>
        <p>This converts the account number to a string. This is necessary because we need to check the length of the account number and inspect its individual digits.</p>
        <li><strong>Check Length of Account Number:</strong></li>
        <pre><code>len(str(account_number)) != 4</code></pre>
        <p><code>len(str(account_number))</code> calculates the length of the account number (as a string). The condition <code>!= 4</code> checks if the length is not equal to 4. If this is true, it means the account number does not have exactly 4 digits.</p>
        <li><strong>Check First Digit of Account Number:</strong></li>
        <pre><code>str(account_number)[0] != '1'</code></pre>
        <p><code>str(account_number)[0]</code> accesses the first character of the account number (as a string). The condition <code>!= '1'</code> checks if the first character is not '1'. If this is true, it means the account number does not start with '1'.</p>
        <li><strong>Combine Conditions with OR Operator:</strong></li>
        <pre><code>if len(str(account_number)) != 4 or str(account_number)[0] != '1':</code></pre>
        <p>The <code>or</code> operator combines the two conditions. The entire condition will be true if either of the individual conditions is true. This means that if the account number is either not 4 digits long or does not start with '1', the combined condition will be true.</p>
        <li><strong>Print Error Message and Return:</strong></li>

            <li>Dividing the remaining legs by 2 gives the number of rabbits (since 4 legs for each rabbit means each rabbit contributes 2 extra legs beyond the 2 legs per head that chickens also have).</li>

    rabbit_count = (legs - 2 * heads) // 2</code></pre>
        <p>This comment indicates that the next line will calculate the number of rabbits using a specific formula.</p>
        <p>The formula used here is <code>(legs - 2 * heads) // 2</code>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>legs - 2 * heads</code>: This part calculates the number of extra legs beyond what would be present if all the animals were chickens. Each chicken has 2 legs, so <code>2 * heads</code> gives the total number of legs if all heads were chickens.</li>
            <li><code>(legs - 2 * heads) // 2</code>: This part divides the extra legs by 2 to convert leg pairs into rabbits (since each rabbit has 4 legs, and the remaining after chickens are considered, each extra 2 legs represent one rabbit). The <code>//</code> operator is used for integer division to ensure that the result is an integer.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><code>python</code></p>
        <pre><code>    chicken_count = heads - rabbit_count</code></pre>
        <p>This line calculates the number of chickens:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>heads - rabbit_count</code>: Since the total number of heads is known (heads), and the number of rabbits has been calculated (rabbit_count), subtracting the number of rabbits from the total heads gives the number of chickens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of rabbits is calculated by determining how many legs are left after accounting for all animals having at least two legs (like chickens).</li>
            <li>The number of chickens is then determined by subtracting the number of rabbits from the total number of heads.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These steps utilize the given heads and legs counts to deduce the specific numbers of chickens and rabbits on the farm.</p>

        <h3>Code Explanation</h3>

        <p><code># Validate the solution</code></p>
        <p>This comment indicates that the next block of code will check whether the calculated numbers of chickens and rabbits are valid based on the given conditions.</p>

        <p><code>if rabbit_count >= 0 and chicken_count >= 0 and 2 * chicken_count + 4 * rabbit_count == legs:</code></p>
        <p>This <code>if</code> statement contains multiple conditions to ensure the solution is valid:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>rabbit_count >= 0</code>: Ensures that the number of rabbits is non-negative (since you can't have a negative number of animals).</li>
            <li><code>chicken_count >= 0</code>: Ensures that the number of chickens is non-negative.</li>
            <li><code>2 * chicken_count + 4 * rabbit_count == legs</code>: Verifies that the total number of legs calculated matches the given number of legs. This condition checks if the sum of the legs of the calculated chickens and rabbits equals the provided total legs. Specifically:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>2 * chicken_count</code> is the total number of legs from chickens.</li>
                    <li><code>4 * rabbit_count</code> is the total number of legs from rabbits.</li>
                    <li>The sum of these should equal the <code>legs</code> parameter.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><code>print(chicken_count, rabbit_count)</code></p>
        <p>If all conditions in the <code>if</code> statement are true, this line prints the number of chickens and rabbits calculated.</p>

        <p><code>else:<br>    print(error_msg)</code></p>
        <p>If any of the conditions in the <code>if</code> statement are false, the code executes the <code>else</code> block. This line prints the error message "No solution", indicating that it's not possible to have the given number of heads and legs with the numbers of chickens and rabbits calculated.</p>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The validation ensures that the calculated numbers of chickens and rabbits are realistic (non-negative) and match the given number of legs.</li>
            <li>If the validation is successful, it prints the calculated numbers of chickens and rabbits.</li>
            <li>If the validation fails, it prints "No solution" to indicate that the input numbers cannot represent a valid combination of chickens and rabbits.</li>

  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>Imagine you have a range of numbers from one to another, like from 1 to 100. You need to find the biggest number within this range that meets certain rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The number should have only two digits, like 10, 11, 12, ... up to 99.</li>
    <li>The sum of the digits in the number should be a multiple of 3. For example, the digits of 12 add up to 3, so it's okay. But for 13, the sum is 4, which isn't a multiple of 3.</li>
    <li>The number itself should be a multiple of 5. So, it should end in 0 or 5.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your job is to figure out the biggest number within this range that fits all these rules. If there isn't any number that meets all the conditions, or if the given range isn't valid (like the starting number being larger than the ending number), then the answer will be -1.</p>

    <p>Function Definition:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">def find_max(num1, num2):
    </code></pre>
    <p>The <code>find_max</code> function takes two arguments: <code>num1</code> (the starting number of the range) and <code>num2</code> (the ending number of the range).</p>



    <p>Initializing <code>max_num</code>:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">max_num = -1
    </code></pre>
    <p>Initialize the variable <code>max_num</code> to -1. This variable will hold the maximum number that meets the given conditions.</p>

    <pre><code class="python">for num in range(num1, num2 + 1):
    </code></pre>
    <p>Iterate through each number in the range from <code>num1</code> to <code>num2</code> (inclusive).</p>



    <p>Check Conditions:</p>

    <p>Return the maximum number found that satisfies all the conditions. If no such number is found, -1 will be returned.</p>



    <p>Testing the Function:</p>

    </code></pre>
    <p>Call the <code>find_max</code> function with <code>num1 = 10</code> and <code>num2 = 100</code>, and print the result.</p>
</div>

    </div>
  <div class="container">
    <p>The variable <code>max_num</code> is initialized to -1 at the beginning of the function because it acts as a placeholder to store the maximum number that satisfies the given conditions.</p>
    <p>Initially setting it to -1 serves as a default value in case there are no numbers in the given range that meet the conditions. If no such number is found during the iteration, the function will return -1, indicating that there is no valid number in the range.</p>
    <p>In simple terms, <code>max_num = -1</code> ensures that if no eligible number is found, the function will return -1 as an indication that there is no maximum number meeting the criteria within the specified range.</p>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <h2>Explanation of the for loop</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The for loop with <code>range(num1, num2 + 1)</code> is used to iterate over all the numbers in the specified range, including both <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code>.</li>
    <li><code>num1</code> is the starting number of the range.</li>
    <li><code>num2</code> is the ending number of the range.</li>
    <li><code>+ 1</code> is added to <code>num2</code> in the <code>range()</code> function because <code>range()</code> generates numbers up to, but not including, the end value. By adding 1, we ensure that <code>num2</code> is included in the range.</li>
    <li>So, the loop iterates over all numbers starting from <code>num1</code> up to and including <code>num2</code>, allowing us to evaluate each number in that range.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <h2>Explanation of the digit sum calculation</h2>
  <p>Let's break it down:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>str(num):</code> This converts the current number <code>num</code> to a string. For example, if <code>num</code> is 25, <code>str(num)</code> becomes "25".</li>
    <li><code>for digit in str(num):</code> This loops over each character (digit) in the string representation of <code>num</code>. For example, if <code>num</code> is 25, it loops over "2" and "5".</li>
    <li><code>int(digit):</code> This converts each character (digit) back to an integer. For example, if <code>digit</code> is "2", <code>int(digit)</code> becomes 2.</li>
    <li><code>sum(...):</code> This calculates the sum of all the integers obtained from the digits of <code>num</code>. For example, if <code>num</code> is 25, it calculates the sum of 2 and 5, which is 7.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So, the whole line <code>digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))</code> calculates the sum of the digits of the current number <code>num</code>, like adding up the digits of a number to find its total value. This sum is then stored in the variable <code>digit_sum</code> for later use.</p>
    <h2>Explanation of Calculating the Sum of Digits</h2>
  <p>The logic behind calculating the sum of digits is essential for this problem because one of the conditions to determine the maximum number is based on the sum of the digits being a multiple of 3.</p>
  <h3>Breakdown:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Sum of Digits:</strong> We need to check if the sum of the digits of a number is a multiple of 3. For example, in the number 27, the sum of digits is 2 + 7 = 9, which is a multiple of 3.</li>
    <li><strong>Condition Check:</strong> To determine if the sum of digits is a multiple of 3, we calculate it for each number in the range and then check if it satisfies this condition.</li>
    <li><strong>Applicability:</strong> If the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, it indicates that the number itself is divisible by 3. This condition, along with the other conditions specified in the problem statement, helps in identifying the maximum number that meets all the criteria.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In summary, calculating the sum of digits helps filter out numbers that meet the conditions specified in the problem statement, leading to the determination of the maximum number satisfying all requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <h2>Explanation of Updating the Maximum Number</h2>
  <p>We use this part of the code to ensure that we are considering the largest number that meets all the given conditions. Here's why we need it:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Checking for Largest Number:</strong> Since we are iterating through all numbers in the specified range, we need to keep track of the largest number that satisfies all the conditions. This ensures that we eventually find the maximum possible number that meets the criteria.</li>
    <li><strong>Updating max_num:</strong> Initially, max_num is set to -1 to indicate that we haven't found any number meeting the conditions yet. As we iterate through the numbers, if we find a number that satisfies all the conditions and is larger than the current max_num, we update max_num to this new value. This process continues until we finish checking all numbers in the given range.</li>
    <li><strong>Ensuring Correct Output:</strong> By continuously updating max_num with the largest valid number encountered during the iteration, we ensure that we ultimately obtain the maximum number that satisfies all the given conditions.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In summary, this part of the code is crucial for determining and updating the maximum number that meets the specified criteria as we iterate through the range of numbers.</p>

 <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction to Collections</h2>
        <p>We can store the ticket numbers by creating one variable for each passenger.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ticket_no_1 = 78808</li>
            <li>ticket_no_2 = 26302</li>
            <li>ticket_no_n = 48310</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However it may not be a good idea. We need a way to store these ticket numbers independent of the number of tickets.</p>
        <p>For this we can use collections, where data can be stored together. There are many collection data types which are supported by programming languages.</p>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Exploring Lists</h2>
        <p>Let’s start by exploring one of the most common collection data type – list. It can be used to store a group of elements together in a sequence.</p>
        <p>Suppose we want to store the ticket numbers allocated to each passenger traveling in a flight. Instead of using separate variable for each ticket number, we can use a list as shown below.</p>

        <img src="49.png" alt="Example of using list to store ticket numbers">
         <p>In case of having different variables for each ticket number, variables will be stored in separate memory locations. Whereas in case of list, the elements will be stored in contiguous memory locations.

</p>
           <img src="50.png" alt="Example of using list to store ticket numbers">
         <p>Each element in the list has a position in the list known as an index. The list index starts from zero. It’s like having seat numbers starting from 0!</p>
        <img src="51.png" alt="Example of using list to store ticket numbers">
        <p>Suppose seat number 2 is allocated to the passenger with ticket number 93634, the passenger can directly go to seat number 2 without having to go through other seats. Similarly, index positions actually help us to directly access a value from the list.</p>
        <p>list_name[index] can be used to directly access the list element at the mentioned index position.</p>
        <p>Suppose we have to allocate a different passenger to seat number 3, we can do it as ticket_list[3]=13504. Thus, in addition to using the index to access an element directly, we can also use it to directly modify an element in the list.</p>
        <p>Just like how we cannot allocate 101st seat to a passenger in a 100 seat plane, we cannot access values beyond the total number of elements in the list.</p>
        <p>For example: print(ticket_list[5]) will result in index out of bound error.</p>
    </div>
       <div class="container">
        <h2>Creating a List in Python</h2>

        <h3>Creating an Empty List:</h3>
        <pre>
<code>sample_list = []</code>
        </pre>
        <p>This creates a list with no elements.</p>

        <h3>Creating a List with Known Size and Known Elements:</h3>
        <pre>
<code>sample_list1 = ["Mark", 5, "Jack", 9, "Chan", 5]
sample_list2 = ["Mark", "Jack", "Chan"]</code>
        </pre>
        <ul>
            <li>sample_list1 has six elements, including both strings and integers.</li>
            <li>sample_list2 has three string elements.</li>
            <li>A list can contain different types of elements (heterogeneous).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Creating a List with Known Size but Unknown Elements:</h3>
        <pre>
<code>sample_list = [None] * 5</code>
        </pre>
        <p>This creates a list with five elements, all initially set to None, indicating that the values are unknown.</p>

        <h3>Length of the List</h3>
        <p>To find out how many elements are in the list, use the len() function:</p>
        <pre>
<code>len(sample_list)</code>
        </pre>
        <p>This will return the number of elements in sample_list.</p>

        <h3>Random Access of Elements</h3>
        <h4>Random Read:</h4>
        <pre>
<code>print(sample_list[2])</code>
        </pre>
        <p>This retrieves and prints the element at index position 2 of sample_list.</p>

        <h4>Random Write:</h4>
        <pre>
<code>sample_list[2] = "James"</code>
        </pre>
        <p>This changes the element at index position 2 to "James". Lists in Python are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed.</p>

        <h3>Other Operations</h3>
        <h4>Adding an Element to the End of the List:</h4>
        <pre>
<code>sample_list.append("James")</code>
        </pre>
        <p>This adds "James" to the end of sample_list. Lists in Python can grow dynamically, so you don't need to define their size in advance.</p>

        <h4>Concatenating Two Lists:</h4>
        <pre>
<code>new_list = ["Henry", "Tim"]
sample_list += new_list
sample_list = sample_list + new_list</code>
        </pre>
        <ul>
            <li>sample_list += new_list: This appends all elements of new_list to the end of sample_list.</li>
            <li>sample_list = sample_list + new_list: This creates a new list by combining elements of the original sample_list and new_list and assigns it to sample_list.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating Lists: You can create lists with specific or unknown elements.</li>
            <li>Accessing Elements: You can read and modify elements at specific positions.</li>
            <li>List Operations: Lists can dynamically grow, and you can concatenate them with other lists.</li>
            <li>Mutability: Lists in Python are mutable, meaning you can change their elements after creation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This explanation covers creating lists, accessing elements, and performing common operations on lists in Python.</p>

        <p>Python offers a simple solution in the form of slicing:</p>
        <pre>
<code>sub_list = list_of_airlines[1:4]</code>
        </pre>
        <p>The above line provides a sub list from index position 1 to 3 (i.e., 1 to (4-1)).</p>
        <p>Indices may also be considered negative as shown above. This is normally used to count from right. For example: To fetch the second last airline in the list, we can write list_of_airlines[-2]. This is equivalent to list_of_airlines[len(list_of_airlines)-2]. Negative indices can also be used for slicing. For example: list_of_airlines[-4:-1] will give us the same output as list_of_airlines[1:4].</p>
        <p>Try out the below code and observe the result. Also, assign the following to new_list and observe the results.</p>
        <pre>
<code>list_of_airlines[1:]
list_of_airlines[:2]
list_of_airlines[:-2]
list_of_airlines[-5:]</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Also, try out:</p>
        <pre>
<code>list_of_airlines[1:-2]
list_of_airlines[:5]
list_of_airlines[-6:]
list_of_airlines[-6:2]

        <p>Of course, we can use a list but anybody can modify an element in the list. This is where we can use another collection data type known as tuple.</p>
        <p>Like list, tuple can also store a sequence of elements but the value of the elements cannot be changed. (i.e. tuples are IMMUTABLE). Elements can be homogeneous or heterogeneous but they are READ-ONLY.</p>

         <h3>Problem Explanation in Simple English:</h3>
        <p>You need to write a Python program to generate ticket numbers for passengers traveling on a flight. The ticket numbers should follow a specific format and should be generated sequentially for each passenger. Here's the format and rules for generating the ticket numbers:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Format of Ticket Number:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ticket number should look like this: airline:src:dest:number</li>
                    <li>airline: This is a fixed value. For the sample input, it is given as AI or BA.</li>
                    <li>src: This is the first three characters of the source city.</li>
                    <li>dest: This is the first three characters of the destination city.</li>
                    <li>number: This is an auto-generated number starting from 101.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Program Requirements:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The program should generate ticket numbers for the specified number of passengers.</li>
                    <li>The program should return the list of ticket numbers for the last five passengers.</li>
                    <li>If the number of passengers is less than 5, return the list of all generated ticket numbers.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p><strong>Input:</strong></p>
        <pre>
airline = AI
source = Bangalore
destination = London
no_of_passengers = 10
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre>
['AI:Ban:Lon:106', 'AI:Ban:Lon:107', 'AI:Ban:Lon:108', 'AI:Ban:Lon:109', 'AI:Ban:Lon:110']
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The program generates ticket numbers from 101 to 110 for 10 passengers. It returns the last five ticket numbers.</p>
        <p><strong>Input:</strong></p>
        <pre>
airline = BA
source = Australia
destination = France
no_of_passengers = 2
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre>
['BA:Aus:Fra:101', 'BA:Aus:Fra:102']
        </pre>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The program generates ticket numbers from 101 to 102 for 2 passengers. Since there are fewer than 5 passengers, it returns all ticket numbers.</p>

        <pre>
<code>def generate_ticket_numbers(airline, source, destination, no_of_passengers):

    <p><strong>Function Definition:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>def generate_ticket(airline, source, destination, no_of_passengers):
    </code></pre>
    <p>This line defines a function named <code>generate_ticket</code> that takes four parameters: <code>airline</code>, <code>source</code>, <code>destination</code>, and <code>no_of_passengers</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>Initialize List:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>ticket_number_list = []
    </code></pre>
    <p>This line initializes an empty list named <code>ticket_number_list</code> to store the generated ticket numbers.</p>

    <p><strong>Extract First Three Characters:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>src = source[:3]
dest = destination[:3]
    </code></pre>
    <p>These lines extract the first three characters of the source and destination cities and store them in variables <code>src</code> and <code>dest</code> respectively.</p>

    <p><strong>Generate Ticket Numbers:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>for i in range(101, 101 + no_of_passengers):
    ticket_number = f"{airline}:{src}:{dest}:{i}"
    ticket_number_list.append(ticket_number)
    </code></pre>
    <p>This loop generates ticket numbers starting from 101 up to 101 + <code>no_of_passengers</code> - 1. Inside the loop:
        A ticket number is formatted using string interpolation (<code>f""</code> syntax) to include the airline code, source, destination, and the sequential number.
        Each generated ticket number is appended to the <code>ticket_number_list</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>Return Last 5 Ticket Numbers:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>if no_of_passengers < 5:
    return ticket_number_list
else:
    return ticket_number_list[-5:]
    </code></pre>
    <p>This conditional statement checks if the number of passengers (<code>no_of_passengers</code>) is less than 5. If there are fewer than 5 passengers, the function returns all the generated ticket numbers (<code>ticket_number_list</code>). Otherwise, if there are 5 or more passengers, it returns the last 5 ticket numbers using list slicing (<code>ticket_number_list[-5:]</code>).</p>

    <p><strong>Test the Function:</strong></p>
    <pre><code># Provide different values for airline, source, destination, no_of_passengers and test your program
print(generate_ticket("AI", "Bangalore", "London", 7))
print(generate_ticket("BA", "Australia", "France", 2))
print(generate_ticket("AI", "New York", "Tokyo", 10))
print(generate_ticket("BA", "Paris", "Rome", 4))
    </code></pre>
    <p>These lines call the <code>generate_ticket</code> function with different sets of input parameters and print the output. They serve as a way to test the function with various scenarios.</p>
<div class="container">
    <p>Certainly! ticket_number_list = [] is an empty list that we initialize at the beginning of the generate_ticket function. We use this list to store the generated ticket numbers as we iterate through the loop. Each ticket number is appended to this list using the append() method. So, by the end of the function, ticket_number_list contains all the ticket numbers generated based on the input parameters provided to the function.</p>
  <p></p>
    <p>This part of the code extracts the first three characters from the source and destination strings. In airline ticketing systems, the source and destination cities are usually represented by their IATA codes, which are three-letter codes assigned to airports. So, by extracting the first three characters, we obtain a shortened version of the source and destination city names, which typically corresponds to their IATA codes. This makes the ticket numbers more concise and standardized. For example, "Bangalore" may be shortened to "Ban" and "London" to "Lon".</p>
<p></p>
    <p>This part of the code generates ticket numbers for the passengers starting from 101 up to 101 + no_of_passengers. It iterates through a range of numbers from 101 to 101 + no_of_passengers, and for each number i, it creates a ticket number string in the format "airline:source:destination:number". Here, airline represents the airline code, src represents the shortened source city code, dest represents the shortened destination city code, and i represents the passenger's ticket number. Each generated ticket number string is then added to the ticket_number_list list. This loop ensures that a unique ticket number is generated for each passenger, incrementing from 101 onwards.</p>
<p></p>
    <p>This part of the code checks the number of passengers (no_of_passengers). If the number of passengers is less than 5, it means there are fewer passengers than the last 5 ticket numbers generated. In this case, it returns all the generated ticket numbers stored in the ticket_number_list.

However, if there are 5 or more passengers, it means there are at least 5 ticket numbers in the list. In this case, it returns the last 5 ticket numbers from the ticket_number_list using list slicing (ticket_number_list[-5:]). This ensures that only the last 5 ticket numbers are returned, even if more than 5 ticket numbers have been generated.</p>

<p>Write a Python program to generate the next 15 leap years starting from a given year. Populate the leap years into a list and display the list. </p>
      <h1>Leap Years</h1>
        <p>This problem requires writing a Python program that generates the next 15 leap years starting from a given year provided by the user. Leap years are those years that are evenly divisible by 4, except for those divisible by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400.</p>
        <p>Here's a breakdown of the steps to solve the problem:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take input from the user for the starting year.</li>
            <li>Check if the starting year is a leap year. If it is, add it to the list of leap years.</li>
            <li>Continue checking subsequent years until we have found the next 15 leap years.</li>
            <li>Populate the leap years into a list.</li>
            <li>Display the list of leap years.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The program should output a list containing the next 15 leap years starting from the provided year. If the user enters a starting year that is a leap year, it should be included in the list of leap years.</p>
        <p>Here's a Python program that accomplishes this task:</p>
